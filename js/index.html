                Claude Shannon's 1950 paper

                    Programming a Computer for Playing Chess</a>
                was a seminal work in the field of Artificial Intelligence, specifically in the area of algorithmic
                decision-making for <em>adversarial games</em>. In this paper, Shannon employs the

                    Minimax Algorithm</a>,
                which takes as its premise that your opponent will always choose the move that is best for them,
                and worst for you. This fundamentally <em>adversarial</em> premise is the same premise that leads to dynamics like

                By teaching the primacy of <em>adversarial algorithms</em> to computer science students for decades,
                have we unwittingly been proliferating adversarial worldviews in our society and in the code that
                increasingly shapes it? Adversarial paradigms of computation can be found in a number of areas.

                The <em>Unimax Algorithm</em> is a cooperative game-playing alternative to the Minimax Algorithm.
                The underlying premise of <em>Unimax</em> is that
                <a href="https://youtu.be/2uI8972y4rc" target="_blank">
                    computation should facilitate the collective flourishing of all beings</a>.
                In the context of chess, this means that each player is trying to avoid capturing the opponent's pieces
                and trying to avoid restricting future movement. The result is that this game of combat, capture, and control
                is transformed into a beautiful, cooperative dance where each move is a gift of creating space.
            </p>
            <p>
                I invite you to watch this traditionally adversarial game being played under a paradigm of collective flourishing.
                I hope that witnessing this conjures other areas of life that are traditionally adversarial and that we
                unquestioningly perpetuate. And I hope it prompts your imagination on how different our movements in the world
                might look if we approach them from a different perspective.
