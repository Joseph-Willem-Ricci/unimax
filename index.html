                Claude Shannon's 1950 paper

                    Programming a Computer for Playing Chess</a>
                was a seminal work for the field of
                Artificial Intelligence, specifically in the area of algorithmic decision-making for
                <em>adversarial games</em>. In this paper, Shannon employs the <em>Minimax Algorithm</em>, which takes
                as its premise that your opponent will always choose the move that is best for them, and worst for you.
                This fundamentally <em>adversarial</em> premise is the same premise that leads to dynamics like

                By teaching this adversarial algorithm to computer science students for decades, have we
                been proliferating an adversarial paradigm in our society and in the code that increasingly shapes it?
                Many dynamics can be modeled through an adversarial lens.

                The <em>Unimax Algorithm</em> is a cooperative game-playing alternative to the Minimax Algorithm.
                The underlying premise of <em>Unimax</em> is that there is only one metric that matters: the collective utility of all players.
                In the context of chess, this means that each player is trying to avoid capturing the opponent's pieces
                and trying to limit future movement as little as possible. The result is a beautiful, cooperative dance
                in which both players move around each other so as to give each other as much space as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                I invite you to watch this traditionally adversarial game being played under a cooperative, collectively-minded paradigm,
                and imagine a world in which the algorithms that shape our society did the same.
