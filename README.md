This is a chess engine using a variant of the Minimax algorithm which I've called Unimax, which aims to maximize both players' collective utility, rather than trying to selfishly maxmimize each player's own utility while minimizing the opponent's utility.

It is an attempt at beginning to imagine and visualize a world where cooperative algorithms supersede adversarial ones.
