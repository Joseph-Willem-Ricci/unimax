This is a chess engine using a variant of the Minimax algorithm which I've called Unimax. Unimax aims to maximize both players' collective utility, rather than trying to selfishly maxmimize each player's own utility while minimizing the opponent's utility.

It is an attempt at beginning to visualize a world where cooperative algorithms supersede adversarial ones.

To run, first be sure you are using a python version > 3.10.12 and you have pip, [the package installer for python installed](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/). Then `pip install pygame` in your terminal, and run `chess_pygame.py`.
